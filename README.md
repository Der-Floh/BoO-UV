# Introduction
BoO-UV stands for Bounty of One - Upgrade Viewer and is a tool to see which Upgrade and / or Object gives you how much of its stats and
additionally adding the overall dps value.

In advance I have to say that the stats are more or less easy calculatable, but the dps values can very quickly become very hard to calculate.
So therefor expect errors in calculations.

## Installation
#### Current Build can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Der-Floh/BoO-UV/releases)
To install simply extract the Contents of the zip and start BoO-UV_0.1.2.0_x64.msix its the installer for the app.
Please note that because this app is programmed in .NET MAUI it only can be installed as an app and not used just as a .exe

## Deinstallation
Note that MAUI Apps are NOT listed under Systemcontrol in Windows but in the normal Settings under Apps -> Apps and Features -> BoO-UV

### When Things go Bad
Should things go bad with the Objects then you can delete their .json file found in the objects folder found when Pressing the savelocation Button in the Settings page
