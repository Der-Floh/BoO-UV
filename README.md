# Introduction
BoO-UV stands for Bounty of One - Upgrade Viewer and is a tool to see which Upgrade and / or Object gives you how much of its stats and
additionally adding the overall dps value.

In advance I have to say that the stats are more or less easy calculatable, but the dps values can very quickly become very hard to calculate.
So therefor expect errors in calculations.

## Currently Worked on
 - Features and Bugfixes for stats and dps calculation

## Current Features
